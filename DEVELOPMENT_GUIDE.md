# DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md

## Introduction
This guide provides best practices for developing the backend with TypeScript/Express and the frontend with TypeScript/React.

## General Best Practices
- **Code Style and Conventions**: Follow consistent naming conventions and code formatting. Use tools like Prettier and ESLint for code quality.
- **TypeScript Features**: Leverage TypeScript's features such as interfaces and types for better type safety.
- **Error Handling**: Implement centralized error handling, and provide meaningful error messages.

## Backend Development (TypeScript/Express)

### Project Structure
```
src/
  ├── controllers/
  ├── models/
  ├── routes/
  ├── middleware/
  ├── services/
  └── index.ts
```

### Setting Up the Express Server
Use a modular approach to set up your Express server.

### Middleware Usage
Utilize middleware for logging, error handling, and request parsing.

### Routing Best Practices
Group routes logically and use versioning for APIs.

### Database Interaction
- Use an ORM like TypeORM or Sequelize for database operations.

### Testing Strategies
- **Unit Testing**: Use Jest for unit tests.
- **Integration Testing**: Ensure endpoints work as expected.

### Security Best Practices
- Validate user input to prevent injection attacks.
- Implement authentication (JWT, OAuth) and authorization.

## Frontend Development (TypeScript/React)

### Project Structure
```
src/
  ├── components/
  ├── hooks/
  ├── contexts/
  ├── services/
  ├── pages/
  └── App.tsx
```

### Component Design Principles
Build reusable components and favor function components with hooks.

### State Management
Consider using Context API or Redux for state management.

### Styling Best Practices
Utilize CSS modules or styled-components for scoped styling.

### Testing Strategies
- **Unit Testing**: Use React Testing Library for testing components.
- **End-to-End Testing**: Use Cypress for comprehensive testing.

### Performance Optimization Techniques
- Utilize React's memoization techniques and lazy loading.

## Deployment
- Follow best practices for deploying your application securely.
- Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated deployments.

## Conclusion
By following these best practices, you contribute to building a robust and maintainable application. Happy coding!
